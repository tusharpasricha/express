### What is Express.js?

Express.js, commonly referred to as Express, is a popular and widely used web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications and APIs in a straightforward and efficient manner. Express.js is designed to be minimal and flexible, allowing developers to create web applications quickly with fewer constraints.

**Key features and characteristics of Express.js:**

1. **Web Server:** Express.js can act as a web server to handle incoming HTTP requests and respond with the appropriate data or content.

2. **Routing:** It offers a robust routing mechanism that allows developers to define various HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and corresponding handlers to process those requests.

3. **Middleware:** Express uses middleware functions that can be used to modify the request and response objects, perform additional tasks, or execute specific code before the final request handler is called. Middleware functions are useful for tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

4. **Templating Engines:** Express.js supports various templating engines (like EJS, Pug, Handlebars) that help in dynamically rendering HTML content on the server-side.

5. **Static File Serving:** It can serve static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) with ease.

6. **Error Handling:** Express provides a simple way to handle errors and display appropriate error messages to clients.

7. **Middleware Ecosystem:** The community has developed a rich ecosystem of middleware packages that can extend the functionality of Express.js.

8. **Extensibility:** Developers can add additional features to Express.js by integrating third-party modules or by building custom middleware.

**Example of an Express.js server:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
